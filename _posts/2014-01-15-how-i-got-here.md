title: How did I get here?

The choice to add Front-End Development to my skill-set comes from a long line of questionable career moves. The first being that I decided to major in the lucrative field of the Fine Arts.

I graduated from the University of North Texas with a double-BFA in Studio Art: Drawing and Painting, and Studio Art: New Media Art. I originally went to school to explore New Media and Video Game design, but found myself longing to work outside of the computer again, with tangible media like oil paint, charcoal, graphite, etc. I finished my New Media Art degree, then stayed in school an extra year to finish my Drawing and Painting Degree.

My degree choices gave me many career options, just none that I felt fully prepared for. I had become disillusioned with the gaming industry and knew it wasn't the life for me. I needed to pay rent, and I had done some design work as a student, so I began freelancing around Austin as a graphic designer. Web design became the most common request amongst my clients, and opportunities arose when I would need to do a little bit more for a client than just <em>design</em> a website, but also prototype in HTML and CSS.

Two years later, and it has become obvious that moving beyond HTML and CSS and exploring JavaScript in-depth will take me down an exciting career path. I look forward to having more control over my projects, being able to work effeciently with a team of developers, and have a deeper understanding of workflow and best practices for web development.
