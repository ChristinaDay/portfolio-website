    <p>
      Christina is a visual artist and designer in the central Austin area. She is currently expanding her front-end  development experience so she can participate more in the web design project workflow.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she isn't creating, Christina enjoys cooking, playing with her dog, rearranging her furniture, and spoenging up pointless trivia about TV shows from the '60's and '70's.
