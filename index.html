      Christina is a visual artist and designer in the central Austin area. She is currently expanding her front-end  development experience so she can participate more in the web design project workflow.

      When she isn't creating, Christina enjoys cooking, playing with her dog, rearranging her furniture, and spoenging up pointless trivia about TV shows from the '60's and '70's.
